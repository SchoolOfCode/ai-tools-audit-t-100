## Subject Matter

Adoption of AI tools by TechForge Industries

TechForge Industries is a 250-strong software development company operating with a range of teams, from front-end development to DevOps and customer support. The company is built around delivering high-quality, innovative software solutions to clients. With a tech stack aligned to modern development practices, TechForge is focused on maximizing efficiency, enhancing team collaboration, and improving the overall customer experience.

## Background Problem

While TechForge is focusing on maximizing efficiency, enhancing team collaboration, and improving the overall customer experience, it's lack of integration with AI tools means it is facing increasing pressure to keep up with rapid technological advancements, and is being overtaken by it's competitors.

## Range of Investigation

We covered two key areas where AI could provide a benefit to TechForge. They are:

- Tools that the entire company can utilise to improve productivity for example meeting note taking and creation of presentations
- Tools specifically tailored to optimise the development experience, via automation of simple boilerplates and code auto-completion as well help with debugging.

## Methods of Analysis

We used Research and User Testing to evaluate the tools we selected.

## Findings

### Microsoft Copilot

Microsoft Copilot is a very useful AI assistant, but the value really only comes if you're utilising the full suite of Microsoft Products. If you are, or planning to, then I highly recommend it, but if you're not then I'd recommend that you look at other tools that perform similar functions

### Github Copilot

By testing GitHub Copilot, we quickly used autocomplete to write functions and methods from the JavaScript library. The AI tool assisted in the development phase by alerting us to errors and suggesting code refactoring. Using prompts, Copilot provided solutions to pseudocoded tasks and optimized the generated code.

### Gamma

Gamma clearly has a lot of features that would benefit the whole company, but in particle, has a lot of features that would benegit a development team, saving a lot of time, delivering value soon and promoting collaboration. Used sensibly, we would recommend Gamma.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

AI can definitely optimise the experience and productivity of a single team as well as the whole company, but requires supervision to ensure it is not causing more harm than good.

Our recommendations are:

- If you're using the Microsoft suite of products, your main AI companion should be Microsoft Copilot as it is integrated into the products and will provide an extended amount of benefit.
- If you're not using Microsoft, then the tools we would recommend are:
  - Github Copilot as it works well in the Github ecosyster and can speed up the development lifecycle, but be careful of an over-reliance on the tool and therefore a lack of understanding of the code.
  - Gamma speeds up the ability to present information back to the team and stakeholders meaning you can focus on the content rather than the aesthetics, but as we have said above, make sure you are sense checking everything it outputs and are also contributing to it yourself to ensure you have an understanding of what you're presenting.
